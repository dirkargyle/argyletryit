		<h2>Namesilo the Best Domain Registrar USA</h2>
		<p>If you're looking for the domain service in the USA in then I recommend Namesilo. For just $8.99 per year, ou can have the best service in the united states</p>
		<h3>Why do I suggest Namesilo?</h3>
		<p>Because it is different from popular GoDaddy and HostGator. Unlike the popular once, you don't need coupons to avail of discounts. Due to their low prices, they don't need to promote lots of coupons.</p>
		<img src="images/prices.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="pricing" >
		<p>They don't have hidden fees. Most registrars offer 30% discount in the first year and charge you more after their promo.</p>
		<p>This is where you pay what you see in their advertisements.</p>
		<h3>How can they offer the lowest prices?</h3>
		<p>They deal only with domains. They don't host websites and that is why they can offer the lowest prices on the web. This is good for us especially if we are building blog networks.</p>
		<p>Even though they offer the lowest prices they have lots of features:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>Email forwarding.</li>
		<li>Free privacy protection.</li>
		<li>Fast loading of the website (Depends on your hosting provider).</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Can we trust them?</p>
		<p>They started offering services since 2009 up to present and continue to give the best service. Their customers trust them and continue to buy from them.</p>
		<p>I trust them I even bought 10 domains in just one month.</p>
		<p>Webmaster's help is not needed in setting up domains. They already offer easy to use templates in setting up name servers.</p>
		<p>You don't need to hire a webmaster to set your website for you. But if you don't know how then it is better to hire a webmaster.</p>
		<p>With email forwarding, you can use it up to 100 emails using your domain.</p>
		<p>For example, info@yourdomain.com and it will be forwarded to your own email address.</p>
		A good trick is to use email forwarding and send all emails to your private email address. Then use MailChimp to reply to your visitors. You don't need to have an email hosting service.
		<p>Although they don't have email support, they have email and chat support. Based on my experience they offer fast support and respond within 24 hours.</p>
		<p>If you're looking for free privacy protection(whois privacy protection). They give it for free. One thing you need to confirm with support is that you need to set it to use unique email.</p>
		<p>If you buy 100 domains with whois privacy protection set it the right way. Do not to register with one who is email.</p>
		<p>To solve the problem you need to contact them.</p>
