		<h2>Domain Registrar with free privacy</h2>
		<p>I agree with you that you need to protect your privacy online. Whois privacy protection is expensive.</p>
		<b>Why does this matter?</b>
		<p>Because you want to protect your identity online. You don't want spammers to send you emails and offer products to sell.</p>
		<p>We are not doing something illegal here. We just want privacy.</p>
		<p>SEOs use this feature to hide the real owner of the website. We will talk about PBNs in the future.</p>
		<b>Do you need private registration?</b>
		<p>Well in this post, you'll know how to register a domain privately every year for free.</p>
		<p>I used to use namecheap free privacy but you have to pay a yearly fee.</p>
		<p>It cost 2 to 15 dollars per year. It's cheap but what if you can get it for free.</p>
		<p>You can read my <a href="http://www.demdodo.com/review/namesilo">namesilo review here</a>. It is a great domain registrar with free privacy protection.</p>
