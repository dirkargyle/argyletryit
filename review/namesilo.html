		<p>Excellent registrar! Quality service although with low pricing.</p>
		<h3>Affordable Review @ $8.99</h3>
		<p>Namesilo started its company since the year 2009 and they offer their cheapest domain names. They focus on domain registry and not offering kinds of hosting services.</p>
		<p>I think Namesilo web hosting is possible in the future.</p>
		<p>They run their business in Phoenix, Arizona. I trust them and will buy more domains.</p>
		<p>I found them to be reliable. I never had a problem with them although they are not perfect.</p>
		<p>I'm happy with their service, I even bought argyletryit.com for $8.99.  I think people use it due to low pricing.</p>
		<p>They address a lot of complaints due to the high cost of domain names.</p>
		<p>ICANN accredited Namesilo for its excellent service.</p>
		<p>As of today, they have over 20,000 loyal customers around the world.</p>
		<p>Why ICANN accreditation is important?</p>
		<p>With ICANN accreditation, you can expect the best service. Namesilo follows all the rules and regulations imposed by ICANN review.</p>
		<h3>Let's compare Namesilo pricing with other Name Registrars</h3>
		<img src="namesilo-pricing.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="pricing" >
		<p>If you buy from their service I'm pretty sure you can save money online with bulk buying.</p>
		<p>*Prices are based on our last visit to the site.</p>
		<p>Compare it vs Namecheap? I think you know the difference.</p>
		<p>Good prices and structure if you buy in bulk.</p>
		<p>Imagine buying 100-1000 domains....</p>
		<p>Imagine buying 100-2000 domains....</p>
		<p>How much can you save?</p>
		<p>Great domains with great prices.</p>
		<p>As a customer, I have good experience with this company.</p>
		<p>I have 50 domains in my account in this company. I think I will add more in the future when my customer grows.</p>
		<p>What we like about their services is that they don't have hidden fees.</p>
		<p>They have domain defender. Prevents changes unless you have answered  5 security questions. Can you suggest other name registrars with this feature?</p>
		<p>You'll notice they don't have much advertising because they rely on the word of mouth.</p>
		<p>Read also: Why Separate Name Registrar and Hosting?</p>
		<p><b>Free Whois Privacy protection for life:</b> Privacy protection is always free. (e.g. hide your name and other details). Namecheap.com offer it in the first year only. This is a new way to attract more customers.</p>
		<p>The company provides this free feature as long as you own the domain.</p>
		<p>This is one of the best features they give to their customers.</p>
		<p><b>No Upsells:</b></p>
		<p>I like Namesilo because they don't have upsells. They focus only on domain hosting. They don't have constant upsell. I hate other registrars because they always send emails for you to buy something.</p>
		<p>They are different from other companies.</p>
		<p>Bulk domain savings allows you to save more!  It is straight forward.</p> 
		<p><b>Fixed price:</b> There is no need to find discount or renewal coupons because the price is fixed.</p>
		<p>Other registrars don't offer a discount on their renewal.</p>
		<p>all Namesilo prices are already discounted every year.</p>
